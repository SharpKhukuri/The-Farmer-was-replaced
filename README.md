**The Farmer was Replaced** <br/>
This repository contains all codes used to simulate farming in the game "The Farmer Was Replaced"<br/>
Really good game to learn how to code with Python.<br/>
Although it doesn't use Python exactly, it uses a system that is really close to Python.<br/>
Here I learned how to use Functions, Dictionaries, Lists..... <br/>
It is a hands on experience on what you learn throught tutorials <br/>
